The majority of parents believe that school buses are generally dangerous for their children, and the usage of
private automobiles exacerbates the already intolerable traffic gridlock. However, the usage of private automobiles may
be decreased and the amount of traffic in cities, particularly during school hours, can be reduced with the introduction of
safe and convenient school buses. The suggested clever and safe tracking system for school buses allows parents to keep
track of all of the vehicles. This system's Android application may be used to deliver alerts to students as they enter and
depart the building using barcode scanners, confirming the student's entrance using dual authentication. The goal of the
study is to show that a secure tracking system might be used to create a safe and intelligent school bus. The outcome of
this study project is anticipated to increase the trust and dependability of parents in school buses and decrease the usage
of private transportation. The pupil will be kept secure, which will reduce anxiety for the parents, and the city's traffic
system will run smoothly.
